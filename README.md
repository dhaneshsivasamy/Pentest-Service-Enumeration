# Pentest-Service-Enumeration

## Purpose
Suggests binaries to run against services found during the enumeration phase of a Pentest

## Background
While studying for the Offensive Security Certified Profesional (OSCP) certification I found it hard to keep track of which commands to run during the enumeration phase for specific services.
